iTermColor
Set colors &amp; fonts for iTerm or terminal on MAC OS


iTerm2 install
Since we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command-line, let's install a better terminal than the default one. Download and install iTerm2.
In Finder, drag and drop the iTerm Application file into the Applications folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the Launchpad for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences.

Colors and Font Settings
1. Set hotkey to open and close the terminal to command + option + i
2. Go to profiles -> Default -> Terminal -> Check silence bell
3. Download one of iTerm2 color schemes from here. And then set these to your default profile colors.

4. Change the cursor text and cursor color
5. Change the font to 13pt Source Code Pro Lite. Source Code Pro can be downloaded from here.

6. If you're using BASH instead of ZSH you could add ~/.color_setting ( or ~/.color_setting1 ...) line to your ~/.bash_profile.
   Then download my .color_setting file ( or .color_setting file...) and copy it to your home directory ~/
